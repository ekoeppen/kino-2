This is the Kino 2 package, an XML/CSS processor. It contains the
following parts:

- The parser library (libkinoparser) which handles XML, HTML and
  CSS. It is tree-based, constructing a parse tree during the parsing
  process.

- The Kino widget (libkinowidget), an Xt widget usable for displaying
  the parsed data.

- The AHD library (libkinoahd) which makes it possible to handle XML
  documents with embedded scripts. For more on this, see the doc
  directory.

- Integration components to use the Kino 2 package from within the
  Wafe environment (see also http://nestroy.wi-inf.uni-essen.de).

The toplevel directory of this package contains the following
subdirectories:

- parser: the parser library
- widget: the Kino widget
- ahd: AHD support library
- wrappers: wrappers for SWIG (*Note*: these can only be built after the
  parser and ahd library have been installed via "make install"!)
- wafe: files to be used for the Wafe integration
- doc: additional documentation, sample code and the interface definition
- test: test and sample code

Please refer to the files INSTALL for installation instructions and
COPYING for the copyright status of the package.

The Kino 2 package is Open Source software, contributions, bug reports
and other feedback is always welcome. The current maintainer is
Eckhart Köppen <Eckhart.Koeppen@uni-essen.de> who is currently
developing the Kino package as part of his Ph.D. thesis at the
University of Essen, Germany. The package is available either through
the main web page at

  http://nestroy.wi-inf.uni-essen.de/Koeppen/Kino/

or through CVS at the following repository:

  :pserver:kino@nestroy.wi-inf.uni-essen.de:/home/cvs

under the module name "kino-2".

In case you are wondering, yes, there is also a Kino 1 package which
is mainly an Xt widget for HTML rendering. It was used as the basis
for the Kino 2 package, extending it in various ways.
