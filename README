This is the Kino 2 package, an XML/CSS processor. It contains the
following parts:

- The parser library (libkinoparser) which handles XML, HTML and
  CSS. It is tree-based, constructing a parse tree during the parsing
  process.

- The Kino widget (libkinowidget), an Xt widget usable for displaying
  the parsed data.

- The AHD library (libkinoahd) which makes it possible to handle XML
  documents with embedded scripts. For more on this, see the doc
  directory.

- Integration components to use the Kino 2 package from within the
  Wafe environment (see also http://nm.wu-wien.ac.at/nm/wafe).

The toplevel directory of this package contains the following
subdirectories:

- parser: the parser library
- widget: the Kino widget
- ahd: AHD support library
- wrappers: wrappers for SWIG (*Note*: these can only be built after the
  parser and ahd library have been installed via "make install"!)
- wafe: files to be used for the Wafe integration
- doc: additional documentation, sample code and the interface definition
- test: test and sample code

Please refer to the files INSTALL for installation instructions and
COPYING for the copyright status of the package.

The Kino 2 package is Open Source software, contributions, bug reports and
other feedback is always welcome. The current maintainer is Eckhart Köppen
<support@40hz.org> who wrote Kino 2 as part of his Ph.D. thesis at the
University of Essen, Germany:

In case you are wondering, yes, there is also a Kino 1 package which
is mainly an Xt widget for HTML rendering. It was used as the basis
for the Kino 2 package, extending it in various ways.
