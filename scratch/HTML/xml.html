<h2><a name="overview">XML: Overview</a></h2>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19971219]</em> <a href="#contents">[Table of Contents]</a></p></rev>

<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is descriptively identified as "an extremely simple dialect of SGML" the goal of which "is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML," for which reason "XML has been designed for ease of implementation, and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML."  XML was initially "developed by a W3C Generic SGML Editorial Review Board formed under the auspices of the W3 Consortium in 1996 and chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems, with the very active participation of a Generic SGML Working Group also organized by the W3C." An XML WG (Working Group) under W3C now serves as an editorial board, which receives input from an XML Special Interest Group.</p>

<p>"Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of data objects called XML documents and partially describes the behavior of computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language. By construction, XML documents are conforming SGML documents."</p>

<p>"XML is primarily intended to meet the requirements of large-scale Web content providers for industry-specific markup, vendor-neutral data exchange, media-independent publishing, one-on-one marketing, workflow management in collaborative authoring environments, and the processing of Web documents by intelligent clients. It is also expected to find use in certain metadata applications. XML is fully internationalized for both European and Asian languages, with all conforming processors required to support the Unicode character set in both its UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings. The language is designed for the quickest possible client-side processing consistent with its primary purpose as an electronic publishing and data interchange format." [971208 W3C press release]</p>

<p>"XML documents are made up of storage units called <i>entities</i>, which contain either parsed or unparsed data.  Parsed data is made up of <i>characters</i>, some of which form the <i>character data</i> in the document, and some of which form <i>markup</i>.  Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on the storage layout and logical structure.  A software module called an <b>XML processor</b> is used to read XML documents and provide access to their content and structure.   It is assumed that an XML processor is doing its work on behalf of another module, called the <b>application</b>. This specification describes the required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML data and the information it must provide to the application." [adapted from the Proposal]</p>

<p>Valid XML documents are designed to be valid SGML documents, but XML documents have additional restrictions.  The W3C XML WG has published a technical NOTE providing a "detailed comparison of the additional restrictions that XML places on documents beyond those of SGML":  see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml</a> for the details.  The NOTE also includes an SGML declaration which describes the constraints of XML applicable to an SGML parser. [<a href="w3cNOTE-SGML-XML.html">local archive copy</a>]</p>

<p>[This paragraph is superseded by the technical NOTE 'NOTE-sgml-xml' referenced immediately above.]  Features in SGML but not in XML include [as of November 5, 1996]:  "Tag omission; The CONCUR, LINK, DATATAG, and SHORTREF features;  The "&amp;" connector in content models; Inclusions and exclusions in content models;  CURRENT, CONREF, NAME, NAMES, NUMBER, NUMBERS, NUTOKEN, and NUTOKENS declarations for attributes;  The NET construct;  Abstract syntax;  Capacities and quantities;  Comments appearing within other markup declarations;  Public Identifiers;  Omission of quotes on attribute values."  For a more recent/complete comparison of features, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xml.html#sec-xml-and-sgml">the relevant section in the language specification</a>, or <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-DTD">"What else has changed between SGML and XML?"</a> in the FAQ, maintained by Peter Flynn.</p>

<p>As of December 1997, the current and former members of the XML WG are:  "Jon Bosak, Sun (Chair); James Clark (Technical Lead); Tim Bray, Textuality and Netscape (XML Co-editor); Jean Paoli, Microsoft (XML Co-editor); C. M. Sperberg-McQueen, U. of Ill. (XML Co-editor); Dan Connolly, W3C; Steve DeRose, INSO; Dave Hollander, HP; Eliot Kimber, Highland; Eve Maler, ArborText; Tom Magliery, NCSA; Murray Maloney, Muzmo and Grif; Makoto Murata, Fuji Xerox Information Systems; Joel Nava, Adobe; Peter Sharpe, SoftQuad; John Tigue, DataChannel."</p>

<p>Historically: The W3C SGML Editorial Review Board, as of November 5, 1996, had the following members: Jon Bosak, Sun (jon.bosak@sun.com), chair; Tim Bray, Textuality (tbray@textuality.com), editor; James Clark (jjc@jclark.com), technical lead; Dan Connolly (connolly@w3.org), W3C contact; Steve DeRose, EBT (sjd@ebt.com), editor; Dave Hollander, HP (dmh@hpsgml.fc.hp.com); Eliot Kimber, Passage Systems (kimber@passage.com); Tom Magliery, NCSA (mag@ncsa.uiuc.edu); Eve Maler, ArborText (elm@arbortext.com); Jean Paoli, Microsoft (jeanpa@microsoft.com); Peter Sharpe, SoftQuad (peter@sqwest.bc.ca); C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen, U. of Ill. at Chicago (cmsmcq@uic.edu), editor.</p>

<p>The XML applications and announced industry initiatives listed below have not been evaluated according to any serious criteria for quality and genuineness.  Since the various specifications documents for XML/XLink/XSL are still in some flux, it would often be unfair or difficult to make such a judgment.  Obviously, many of these application areas provide exemplary models, having unquestioned integrity and high quality.  Some already play a vital role in profitable commercial enterprise.  It is also to be expected that some early XML/XLink/XSL applications may be merely demonstrations, toys, proof-of-concept applications; still others might be naive or ill conceived.  It may be necessary to regard some of these ideas 'in draft' like some of the specifications documents themselves.  The good news is this:  Net users are seeing clearly that a fixed tag set (like HTML) is not the solution. . .</p>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980502]</em></p></rev>

<p>The W3C's XML Recommendation 1.0 (February 1998) and several related classes of W3C XML-related specifications documents have been <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.xml">produced in XML</a> according to a formal document model expressed in an XML DTD.  Such a DTD has been "developed for use with the XML family of W3C specifications.  It is an XML-compliant DTD based in part on the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/lite/index.html">TEI Lite</a> and Sweb DTDs."   Major contributors to the design of the DTD, as named, include:  Jon Bosak, Sun (XML chair), Tim Bray, Textuality and Netscape (XML co-editor),  Dan Connolly, W3C (W3C staff contact),  Eve Maler, ArborText (DTD maintainer), Gavin Nicol, Inso (DOM member), C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen, University of Illinois (XML co-editor), and Lauren Wood, SoftQuad (DOM chair).  The W3C XML DTD is subject to minor change as the W3C's documentation requirements are refined.  This "XML specification DTD" has been documented in an accompanying commentary, <cite>Design Report for the W3C XML Specification DTD</cite>.  The report describes the design and implementation of the XML DTD used for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications and notes related to XML.</p>

<h3><a name="dom">Document Object Model (XML) [Level 1]</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980403]</em></p></rev>

<p>"The goal of the DOM group is to define a programmatic interface for XML and HTML. The DOM is separated into three parts: Core, HTML, and XML.  The Core DOM provides a low-level set of objects that can represent any structured document.  While by itself this interface is capable of representing any HTML or XML document, the core interface is a compact and minimal design for manipulating the document's contents.  Depending upon the DOM's usage, the core DOM interface may not be convenient or appropriate for all users.  The HTML and XML specifications provide additional, higher-level interfaces that are used with the core specification to provide a more convenient view into the document.  These specifications consist of objects and methods that provide easier and more direct access into the specific types of documents.  Key industry players are participating in the DOM Working Group, including ArborText, Grif, IBM, Inso, Microsoft, Netscape, Novell, the Object Management Group, SoftQuad and Sun Microsystems." The Chair of the W3C DOM WG is Lauren Wood.</p>

<p>The DOM specification "defines the Document Object Model, a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and manipulating them. Vendors can support the DOM as an interface to their proprietary data structures and APIs, and content authors can write to the standard DOM interfaces rather than product-specific APIs, thus increasing interoperability on the Web."

<h3><a name="xml-data">XML-Data</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980501]</em></p></rev>

<p>On January 5, 1998, a new (revised) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-XML-data-0105/Overview.html">submission</a> on XML-Data was presented to the W3C by Microsoft, ArborText, DataChannel, and Inso.  Reference:  W3C Note 05 Jan 1998.   Authors:  Andrew Layman, Edward Jung, Eve Maler, Henry S. Thompson, Jean Paoli, John Tigue, Norbert H. Mikula, and Steve DeRose.   According to the introduction, XML-Data "describes an XML vocabulary for schemas, that is, for defining and documenting object classes.  It can be used for classes which as strictly syntactic (for example, XML) or those which indicate concepts and relations among concepts (as used in relational databases, KR graphs and RDF).  The former are called 'syntactic schemas;' the latter 'conceptual schemas.'  The text of this NOTE thus "provides a specification (XML-Data) for describing and exchanging structured and networked data on the Web. Such exchange is facilitated by schemas defining the characteristics of classes of objects.  The objects can be syntactic constructs such as are used in XML instances, or may be more abstract such as are found in databases, information models or directed, labeled graphs. This paper describes an XML vocabulary for schemas. One immediate implication of these ideas is a substantive part of the functionnalities of XML document types can now be described using the XML instance syntax itself, rather than DTD syntax. We expect XML-Data to be useful for a wide range of applications, such as describing database transfers or remotely-located Web resources."</p>

<p>[Previous draft:] On June 22 1997, Jean Paoli announced a draft specification of an XML application called XML-Data.  The specification is documented in a Position Paper from Microsoft, written by Andrew Layman (Microsoft Corporation), Jean Paoli (Microsoft Corporation), Steve De Rose (Inso Corporation), and Henry S. Thompson (University of Edinburgh), with contributions from Paul Grosso, Sharon Adler, Anders Berglund,  Fran&ccedil;ois Chahuneau, and Edward Jung.   XML-Data is an application of XML for exchanging structured data and metadata on the Internet.  The paper outlines a number of XML-Data design features which are not in the MCF specification.

<h3><a name="xml-namespace">Name Spaces in XML</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980328]</em></p></rev>

<p>The first Working Draft of the W3C XML document <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-xml-names-19980327">Namespaces in XML</a></cite> was released on March 27, 1998.  It was produced as part of the XML Activity, and was previously released in January as a W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119">'NOTE'</a>.  The document editors are:  <a href="mailto:tbray@textuality.com">Tim Bray</a> (XML co-editor, Textuality),  <a href="mailto:dmh@corp.hp.com">Dave Hollander</a> (Hewlett-Packard Company), and <a href="mailto:andrewl@microsoft.com">Andrew Layman</a> (Microsoft).  References:  W3CWD-xml-names-19980327, World Wide Web Consortium Working Draft 27-March-1998.  The namespaces draft "describes a simple method for qualifying certain names used in Extensible Markup Language documents by associating them with namespaces, identified by URI."  In the simplest case, the namespace problem is undeniable and the proposed XML namespace solution is straight-forward (indirection being required by the RFC's lexical rules for URIs).  Pieces of text containing XML markup which might be "cut and pasted" across domains without respect for the (implicit or explicit) source document schemas/DTDs could result in ambiguity as well as name collision.  So:  declarations in the form of XML processing instructions may be put into the prolog of an XML document, as exemplified in <code>&lt;?xml:namespace ns="http://iso-countries.iso.org/199804.html" prefix="cn9804" ?&gt;</code>, and the corresponding prefixes may be added to elements, attributes and processing instructions of the source document instance: (<i>e.g.</i>,) <code>&lt;cn9804:name&gt;Boatia&lt;/cn9804:name&gt;</code>.  In these cases, a processor would be able to make sense of an encoded <i>name</i> element such as "Boatia" by referring to the authority list stored in or referenced by the resource given as a namespace identifier, <i>viz.</i>, 'http://iso-countries.iso.org/199804.html'.  Users should observe the warnings in the working draft, as well as in the cautionary <a href="ns980328Ann.html">note from Jon Bosak</a>, concerning the provisional status of the syntax.  The draft states: "The XML Working Group will not allow early implementation to constrain their ability to make changes to this specification prior to final release."  The XML Working Group anticipates that the namespace facility presented (provisionally) in this draft will be integrated into a future version of the XML specification.</p>

<p>W3C announced the availability of a NOTE on <cite>Name Spaces in XML</cite>, as part of the W3C XML Activity.  References: NOTE-xml-names-19980119, Version 1.0, dated 19-January-1998.  The editors are Tim Bray (Textuality), Dave Hollander (Hewlett-Packard Company), and Andrew Layman (Microsoft); Murata Makoto contributed the operational scenarios in the examples section.  The document abstract says: "XML Namespaces is a proposal for a simple method to be used for qualifying names used in Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents by associating them with schemas, identified by URI."   This NOTE submitted to the Consortium represents a formulation based upon significant prior work, some of which is referenced by entries in the <a href="xml.html#namespacesThompson">XML Page</a>.  The current document is available in HTML and XML format.  The NOTE may be obtained as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119.html">"NOTE-xml-names"</a> from the W3C Web site; or see <a href="xml.html#xml-namespace">the dedicated entry in the XML Page</a>.</p>

<p>XML name spaces are elaborated in the NOTE summary as follows: "We envision applications of XML in which a document instance may contain markup defined in multiple schemas. These schemas may have been authored independently. One motivation for this is that writing good schemas is hard, so it is beneficial to reuse parts from existing, well-designed schemas.   Another is the advantage of allowing search engines or other tools to operate over a range of documents that vary in many respects but use common names for common element types.  These considerations require that document constructs should have universal names, whose scope extends beyond their containing document. This specification proposes a mechanism, <EM>XML Namespaces</EM>, to accomplish this.  XML Namespaces are based on the use of qualified names, similar to those long used in programming languages. Names are permitted to contain a colon, separating the name into two parts, the <i>namespace name</i> and the <i>local name</i>. The namespace name identifies a schema's URI. The combination of the universally-managed URI namespace and the local schema namespace produces names that are guaranteed universally unique."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-rdf">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980419]</em></p></rev>

<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is specification governing the interoperability of applications in terms of metadata property sets.  It is being developed under the authority of the W3C.  The draft specifications from W3C confirm that "RDF will use XML as the transfer syntax in order to leverage other tools and code bases being built around XML..."  The collaborative RDF effort is based upon several other metadata initiatives; the working group responsible for the draft is composed of "key industry players including DVL, Grif, IBM, KnowledgeCite, LANL, Microsoft, Netscape, Nokia, OCLC, Reuters, SoftQuad and University of Michigan."  "RDF metadata can be used in a variety of application areas such as: (1) in resource discovery to provide better search engine capabilities; (2) in cataloging for describing the content and  content relationships available at a particular Web site, page, or digital library; (3) by intelligent software agents to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange; (4) in content rating for child protection and privacy protection; (5) in describing collections of pages that represent a single logical "document"; (6) for describing intellectual property rights of Web pages." [press release October 3, 1997]</p>

<p>"RDF is the result of a number of metadata communities (including Dublin Core, PICS, Digital Signatures) bringing together their needs to provide a robust and flexible architecture for supporting metadata on the Internet and WWW. RDF will use the new XML as its main carrier syntax." [from the DSTC page, where the Resource Description Framework is listed as a <a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/RDU/">Resource Discovery Unit</a> 'Special Project']</p>

RDF for XML is "a Java implementation of the RDF specification for creating technologies that search for data and describe, categorize, rate, and otherwise manipulate the data.  This RDF processor builds, queries, and manipulates RDF structures, and it serializes and de-serializes them to and from XML forms. As a foundation for processing metadata, RDF for XML provides inter-operability between applications that exchange machine-understandable information on the Web.  RDF for XML describes resources and their properties in a domain-independent way. It can be used in a variety of areas, including resource discovery for search engines, cataloging for describing contents, content rating, and so on.

Abstract: "The Dublin Core (DC) community is very interested in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This is due to RDF's promise of becoming a widely-used means for the exchange and processing of resource descriptions. Those descriptions would not only come from the Dublin Core, but might spur the combination of packages along the lines of the Warwick Framework. The RDF-WG has recently produced a document that describes their data model and how it could be mapped to XML syntax. This paper looks at how Dublin Core descriptions might be encoded according to that paper. Based on that examination, we suggest directions of work for the RDF working groups."</li>

<h3><a name="xml-ims">Educom Instructional Management Systems Project (IMS)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980504]</em></p></rev>

<p>Educom's Instructional Management Systems Project (IMS) has released technical "specifications for how learning materials will flow over the Internet, and for how organizations and individual learners will manage the learning process, have broad support among industry and among leaders in higher education, training, government, and K-12 schools.  The goal of Educom's Instructional Management Systems (IMS) project is the widespread adoption of a set of open standards for Internet-based education.  Twenty-eight organizations have made substantial investments in the IMS project and continue active involvement in the technical work, in advanced work with the example implementation, as well as in internal development of products for the new digital education marketplace.  According to the specifications document entitled "EDUCOM/NLII Instructional Management Systems" (Version 0.5, Date: April 29, 1998), IMS Specifications will use XML as the serialization syntax for data and objects.</p>

<p>The IMS Metadata Specification is derived from extensive collaborations, requirements meetings, focus groups and research related to the development of metadata specifications to support online learning.  Groups included in the requirements process included teachers, instructional designers, cognitive psychologists, digital library experts, administrators of educational institutions, software developers, content developers, and metadata experts. . . IMS Metadata will be represented in XML/RDF format.  . .In order to add metadata to web pages (and resources displayed within web pages), IMS recommends embedding inline the Metadata as XML/RDF."</p>

Reference:  W3C NOTE 05-Jan-1998.   The document editor is Eric Berman (Microsoft), and authors include Pete Resnick (Qualcomm) and Nick Shelness (Lotus).  According to the press release, the HTML Threading Proposal "outlines how Extensible Markup Language (XML) can be used to enable data-rich features in HTML email applications."  The document abstract clarifies:  "As [email] messages go back and forth between participants in a discussion, it is interesting to be able to track properties of the text in the message and properties of the message itself, such as who wrote what or what message a quoted excerpt is originally from.  This proposal defines a mechanism for embedding this information within an email message in a manner that degrades gracefully to downlevel mail clients."

<h3><a name="xml-osd">Open Software Description Format (OSD)</a></h3>

<p>A joint submission was made to W3C on August 13, 1997 by Marimba Incorporated and Microsoft Corporation for a proposed "Open Software Description Format (OSD)."  A document 'NOTE-OSD' written by Arthur van Hoff (Marimba, Incorporated), Hadi Partovi and Tom Thai (Microsoft Corporation) bears this abstract:  "This document provides an initial proposal for the Open Software Description (OSD) format.  OSD, an application of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), is a vocabulary used for describing software packages and their dependencies for heterogeneous clients.  We expect OSD to be useful in automated software distribution environments."  The proposed specification has apparently been endorsed by other companies, including "CyberMedia, InstallShield Software, LANovation, Lotus Development, and Netscape Communications." [from <cite>Net.Com</cite> article]</p>

<p>And: "The goal of the OSD format is to provide an XML-based vocabulary for describing software packages and their inter-dependencies, whether it is user initiated ("pulled"), or automatic ("pushed"). XML (eXtensible Markup Language) provides a general method of representing structured data in the form of lexical trees. Using this data model, markup tags in the OSD vocabulary are represented as elements of a tree. The three basic relationships between elements are parent-of, child-of, and sibling-of. Distant relationships can be formed from recursive applications of the three basic ones."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-wapwml">WAP Wireless Markup Language Specification</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980225]</em></p></rev>

<p>"Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry wide standard for developing applications over wireless communication networks.   The WAP Forum, originally founded by Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, and Unwired PlanetWML was formed to create the global wireless protocol specification that works across differing wireless network technology types, for adoption by appropriate industry standards bodies.  WML (Wireless Markup Language) is a markup language based on XML, and is intended for use in specifying content and user interface for narrowband devices, including cellular phones and pagers.  WML is designed with the constraints of small narrowband devices in mind.  These constraints include: 1) Small display and limited user input facilities;  2) Narrowband network connection;  3) Limited memory and computational resources.   WML includes four major functional areas: 1) Text presentation and layout - WML includes text and image support, including a variety of formatting and layout commands;  2) Deck/card organisational metaphor - all information in WML is organised into a collection of cards and decks;  3) Inter-card navigation and linking - WML includes support for explicitly managing the navigation between cards and decks;  4) String parameterization and state management - all WML decks can be parameterised, using a state model."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-drp">HTTP Distribution and Replication Protocol (DRP)</a></h3>

<p>On August 25, 1997 a submission entitled <cite>The HTTP Distribution and Replication Protocol </cite> was tendered to the W3C by representatives of Marimba Inc., Netscape Communications Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Novell Inc., and At Home Corporation. "The goal of the DRP protocol is to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data distribution over HTTP. . . The DRP protocol uses a data structure called an index, which is currently specified using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Because the index describes meta data, we anticipate using the Resource Description Format RDF), which was formerly called the Meta Content Framework (MCF), in a future versions of the DRP protocol specification. XML is used in the interim because the RDF standard was not finalized at the time of writing. . . The DRP defines the following new features: (1) Content identifiers, using the existing URI specification, which can uniquely identify a piece of content;  (2) An index format which can be used to describe a set of files; (3) A new HTTP header field, Content-ID, which is used to obtain the correct version of a file by specifying a content identifier; (4) A new HTTP header field, Differential-ID, which is used to obtain a differential update for a file."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-bsml">Bioinformatic Sequence Markup Language (BSML)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980114]</em></p></rev>

<p>The proposed Bioinformatic Sequence Markup Language (BSML) is a public domain protocol for Graphic Genomic Displays.  The project goals are in some respects similar to those of the <a href="#xml-cml">Chemical Markup Language</a>.   According to the RFC document of December 1997, which specifies a public domain standard for the encoding and display of DNA, RNA and protein sequence information, this markup language is to be based upon SGML and XML: "BSML is written to conform with the XML standard."  Goals in the enoding project are to "describe the features of genetic sequences, describe the features of graphic objects used to represent sequence features, determine procedures for assigning graphic objects to sequence features, and determine how to store and transmit encoded sequence and graphic information."   BSML is a TopoGEN project, funded by an SBIR [Small Business Innovative Research] from the <a href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/">National Center for Human Genome Research</a>, to develop the public domain protocol.  The SBIR with which this project is associated has Joseph Spitzner, Ph. D. (TopoGEN Software Director) as its Principal Investigator.</p>

<p>"Microsoft, Intuit, and CheckFree have joined to develop an open specification for the online transfer of financial data. Open Financial Exchange (OFE) integrates Microsoft's Open Financial Connectivity, Intuit's OpenExchange, and CheckFree's electronic banking and payment protocols."</p>

<p>"Open Financial Exchange is a broad-based framework for exchanging financial data and instructions between customers and their financial institutions. It allows institutions to connect directly to their customers without requiring an intermediary. [...] OFX is based upon SGML and, like XML, it is an attempt to take the best features of SGML and remove much of the associated complexity.  OFX is not technically an XML application.  The syntax of OFX differs from that set out for XML applications in that OFX omits end-tags - XML parsers should be able to correctly interpret documents without a Document Type Definition (DTD).  Like XML, OFX is designed to be both easy to learn and extensible."</p>

<p>Note: According to a posting from Tim Bray, "OFX predates XML, is based on SGML, and uses a form of minimization called end-tag omission that was deliberately left out of XML [...] the OFX people were thinking seriously about fixing this so as to be XML-compliant." (XML-DEV, July 12, 1997)</p>

<p>The Open Trading Protocol (OTP), "a global standard for  retail trade on the Internet has been published and is available now on the Internet.  The complete specification for the Open Trading Protocol (OTP) developed by the leaders in Internet commerce has been posted for public comment, and pilot implementation and trials."  The OTP Consortium now has over 30 member companies.  "The OTP standards enable a consistent framework for multiple forms of electronic commerce, ensuring an easy-to-use and consistent consumer purchasing experience regardless of the payment instrument or software and hardware product  used. The protocol is freely available to developers and users, and builds on XML, an emerging standard for information exchange on the Internet.  As a set of truly open standards, the protocol is not 'owned' by any one company, and its development will be managed by an appropriate independent organization."</p>

<p>An initial design document by 4thWORLD Telecom models information relevant to real estate listings in terms of a draft DTD.  "The real estate DTD(s) needs to work with several different user types; those making MLS entries using custom software (such as OpenMLS), those making MLS entries with standard XML editors, and those who are simply making a web site (separate from MLS entry).  With these scenarios, the DTD must balance the detail needed in the MLS with the simplicity that web developers desire.  In addition, there are no MLS form guidelines given by the NAR (although they may currently be working on some). Therefore a very general purpose MLS form must be distilled from the customized documents that the various Board of Realtors will produce with this DTD. . ."</p>

<p>In response to requirements from the 1990 US Clean Air Act, <a href="http://www.sae.org/">The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)</a> has adopted a number of standards under the 'SAE J2008' family of standards designed to "provide easy access to emission-related automotive service information.  At the heart of this SGML standard is a relational Data Model for Automotive Service Information rather than any particular document model.  The SGML definition set forth within J2008 provides a hierarchical representation of the Data Model.  In addition, this standard provides models for common text constructs such as tables, paragraphs, lists, and procedures which are found within automotive service information."  Recently, as explained by Dianne Kennedy in the presentation "XML and the Automotive Industry" (XML the Conference 98, Seattle 1998), effort has been made to convert the SGML DTD into a version compatible with XML.

<h3><a name="xml-mml">Mathematical Markup Language</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980407]</em></p></rev>

<p>The Mathematical Markup Language (W3C Working Draft) is a specification which "defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML.  MathML is an XML application for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.  The document begins with background information on mathematical notation, the problems it poses, and the philosophy underlying the solutions MathML proposes.  MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content.  About 25 of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another 75 provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression.  Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers.  Finally, the document addresses the issue of MathML entities (extended characters) and their relation to fonts."</p>

<p>[February 24, 1998]   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/PR-math-19980224">MathML</a> (Mathematical Markup Language) specification issued by W3C as a Proposed Recommendation.  Editors: Patrick Ion and Robert Miner.  Reference: PR-math-19980224.   Abstract:  "MathML is a low-level syntax for representing structured data such as mathematics in machine-to-machine communication over the Web, providing a much-needed solution for including mathematical expressions over the Web. In developing MathML, the goal was to define an XML-compliant markup language that describes the content and presentation of mathematical expressions.  This was achieved with MathML.   As an effective way to include mathematical expressions in Web documents, MathML gives control over the presentation and the meaning of such expressions. It does this by providing two sets of markup tags: one set presents the notation of mathematical data in markup format, and the other set relays the semantic meaning of mathematical expressions, enabling complex mathematical and scientific notation to be encoded in an explicit way.  As an XML application, MathML capitalizes on XML features and benefits from the wide support of XML. Unlike HTML which was intended as a markup language for use by people, MathML is intended to be used by machines, facilitating the searching and indexing of mathematical and scientific information. Software tools that work with MathML render MathML into formatted equations, enabling users to edit mathematical equations much as one might edit HTML text. Several early versions of such MathML tools already exist, and a number of others, both freely available software and commercial products, are under development."

<p>On April 9, 1998, the The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/SMIL-PR">announced the release</a> of the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language specification <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/PR-smil-19980409">as a W3C Proposed Recommendation (PR)</a>.</p>

<p>On November 6, 1997 the W3C announced the first public draft specification for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-smil">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language</a>, produced by the W3C Working Group on Synchronized Multimedia (SYMM).  The document is edited by Philipp Hoschka (W3C), and the named authors are: Philipp Hoschka, Stephan Bugaj, Dick Bulterman, Lynda Hardman, Jack Jansen, Rob Lanphier, Nabil Layaida, Jonathan Marsh, Anup Rao, Warner ten Kate, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Michael Vernick, Jin Yu.  Its references: WD-smil-971106, W3C Working Draft 06-November-97.</p>

<p>The draft document "specifies the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced 'smile'). SMIL allows integrating a set of independent multimedia objects into a synchronized multimedia presentation. Using SMIL, presentations such as a slide show synchronized with audio comments or a video synchronized with a text stream can be described [. . .] SMIL documents are well-formed XML documents in the sense of the XML 1.0 draft. For describing the syntax of SMILE documents, this specification uses two notations: (1) an augmented Backus-Naur form (BNF) similar to the one defined for HTTP 1.1, and (2) an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-smil.htm#h-7.3"> XML Document Type Definition (DTD)</a>."</p>

<p>"SMIL was developed by the W3C Synchronized Multimedia (SYMM) Working Group, a unique mix of experts from the four divergent industries (CD-ROM, Interactive Television, Web, and audio/video streaming) interested in bringing synchronized multimedia to the Web. The W3C SYMM Working Group includes both key industry players such as Digital Equipment Corporation, Lucent/Bell Labs, Microsoft, Netscape, Philips, RealNetworks and The Productivity Works, and leading research organisations such as Columbia University, CWI and INRIA."</p>

<h3><a name="pgml">Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980415]</em></p></rev>

<p>On April 03, 1998, a submission was made to the World Wide Web Consortium concerning a proposed <cite>Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML)</cite>.  References: W3C NOTE-PGML-19980410, World Wide Web Consortium Note 10-April-1998, URL http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML-19980410.  The W3C NOTE was submitted by representatives of Adobe Systems Incorporated, International Business Machines Corporation, Netscape Communications Corporation, and Sun Microsystems, Inc.  The abstract: "This document is the specification for the Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML). PGML is a 2D scalable graphics language designed to meet both the simple vector graphics needs of casual users and the precision needs of graphics artists. PGML uses the imaging model common to the PostScript(R) language and Portable Document Format (PDF); it also contains additional features to satisfy the needs of Web applications."  The NOTE is characterized as "a working document. It is not meant to be a complete definition for PGML. Many sections have been left open or have been labeled <i>Ideas for Consideration</i> so that the working group can develop the strongest possible language specification and ensure that it is fully compatible with other W3C standards efforts."</p>

<p>Among the 'Design Principles': PGML should be an XML application and the imaging model is an instance of the RDF data model. . . PGML should be compatible with and fully leverage all related W3C standards efforts. . .in particular, PGML will be an application of XML. . .[provision for ] exporting the imaging model to the DOM."  A W3C '<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1998/06/Comment">Comment</a> on PGML Submission' asserts:  "PGML is expressed in XML, which allows PGML graphics to be modified with style sheets along with the document in which they are contained."  A sample from Appendix B (minus the pretty-printing):  <blockquote><code>&lt;?XML version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE PGML SYSTEM "pgml1.0.dtd"&gt;&lt;pgml boundingbox="0 0 300 300"&gt;&lt;path fill="1" fillcolor="100 0 0"&gt;&lt;moveto x="100" y="100"/&gt;&lt;lineto x="200"/&gt;&lt;lineto y="200"/&gt;&lt;lineto x="100"/&gt;&lt;lineto y="100"/&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/pgml&gt;</code></blockquote>.

<p>XML and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange).  "EDI works by providing a collection of standard message formats and element dictionary in a simple way for businesses to exchange data via any electronic messaging service. . . XML/EDI provides a standard format to describe different types of data -- for example, a loan application, an invoice, healthcare claim, project status -- so that the information can be decoded, manipulated, and displayed consistently and correctly by implementing EDI dictionaries.  Thus by combining XML and EDI we create a new powerful paradigm!"  (Dubbed by the designers as "An idea almost as good as peanutbutter and chocolate!")</p>

<p>In March 1998, the XML-EDI Group become an organization of the Graphic Communications Association Research Institute (GCARI).  GCARI, "an affiliate of Graphic Communications Association (GCA) in Alexandria, Va.

<h3><a name="xml-ice">Information and Content Exchange (ICE)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980422]</em></p></rev>

<p>"Firefly Network, Vignette Corporation, and other Internet leaders today [February 2, 1998] announced Information &amp; Content Exchange (ICE), a proposed protocol designed to significantly reduce the cost of doing business online and increase the value of business relationships by facilitating the controlled exchange and management of electronic assets between networked partners and affiliates.  Applications based on ICE will enable companies to easily construct syndicated publishing networks, Web superstores, and online reseller channels by establishing Web-site-to-Web-site information networks."</p>

<p>"The proposed ICE specification provides businesses with an XML-based common  language and architecture that will facilitate the process of automatically exchanging, updating, supplying, and controlling assets in a trusted fashion (building on OPS/P3P) without manual packaging or knowledge of remote Web site structures.  For consumer Web sites, end users benefit from more complete and easier to use Web destinations that reduce the frustration of having to surf through many inadequate, narrowly-focused Web sites in order to find what they need."  [from the Firefly release]</p>

<p>Members of the ICE working group include[d] Vignette, Microsoft, Firefly, Adobe, JavaSoft, Net Perceptions, News Internet Services, C/Net, Hollinger International, National Semiconductor, Preview Travel, Tribune Media Service, Ziff-Davis, and others.</p>

<p>The ICE Advisory Council will review and suggest changes to the ICE Authoring Group, which is writing the requirements and specification for Information &amp; Content Exchange.  As of April 1998, "more than 40 global companies have joined the Advisory Council."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-tim">Telecommunications Interchange Markup (TCIF/IPI)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980421]</em></p></rev>

<p>The recent revision of the TIM DTD toward version 2 has been motivated, in part, by a desire of the subcommittee to make this news industry DTD XML compliant.  "Information Products Interchange (IPI) is a working committee of the Telecommunications Industry Forum.  IPI was established to select standards and guidelines capable of allowing the interchange of a variety of information products for the telecommunications industry . . . Most of the IPI Committee's published work has to do with the Telecommunications Interchange Markup (TIM, an SGML DTD) and the Telecommunications Electronic Document Delivery Package (TEDD)."</p>

<p>"The TIM Document Type Definition (DTD) is a specification for describing the structure of telecommunications and other technical documents . . . based largely on early versions of the DocBook DTD developed by the Davenport Group.  TIM 1 was approved as a TCIF Guideline in December 1995, and revisions for TIM 2 were begun in December 1996.  As described in the TCIF Information Publication TCIF-IPI-97-004 (Issue 1, 10/24/97), several of the DTD changes were aimed at making the TIM 2 specification XML compliant. These included changes to the SGML declaration, removal of inclusion and exclusion exceptions from content models, implementation of external cross-references through URLs, restricting the attribute data types to the XML-valid AttType values ('TokenizedType' -- in particular, NMTOKEN for NAME, NUMBER, and NUTOKEN), and restriction of PCDATA to content models having repeatable 'OR groups'.  Thus: "except for changes to adapt to the not-yet-finished XLL linking specification, TIM is already XML-complaint and ready for the next generation of browsers."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-ead">Encoded Archival Description (EAD)</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980428]</em></p></rev>

<p>The US Library of Congress and several research level institutions have been engaged in the collaborative work of the EAD (Encoded Archival Description) initiative for several years.   These institutions use the EAD DTD, and currently encode their archival finding aids using the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  "As a potential international standard, the EAD DTD is maintained in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress in partnership with the Society of American Archivists."  The finding aids documents conforming to the EAD DTD are viewable on the Internet using SoftQuad Panorama, or in some cases, are translated into HTML on the fly.   Archival finding aids are "descriptive bibliography" or "metadata" tools which take the form of inventories, registers, indexes, guides, and similar resources created by museums, libraries, repositories, and other kinds of archives.  Daniel Pitti (Project Director, Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities,  University of Virginia) submitted a public posting to the Encoded Archival Description List to the effect "that Version 1 of the EAD DTD will be fully compliant with XML."</p>   

<p>Version 1 of the EAD DTD has been under development for several months, and was recently reviewed for "final" changes in a meeting of October 31-November 2, 1997, by fifteen members of the Encoded Archival Description Working Group of the SAA Committee on Archival Information Exchange.   A summary from the preceding post:  "The EAD Working Group consists of sixteen individuals representing the United Kingdom, Canada, the Library of Congress, the National Archives, the Research Libraries Group and OCLC, and a number of American academic institutions and one historical society who have been involved for almost three years in the development of EAD.  The WG is currently engaged in preparing three documents for final release early this year [1998]: version 1.0 of the EAD DTD, the Tag Library, and a set of Application Guidelines."</p>

<h3><a name="tmx">Translation Memory eXchange</a></h3>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19971212]</em></p></rev>

<p>Developed under the Localisation Standards Industry Association, TMX is designed "to allow easier exchange of translation memory data between tools and/or translation vendors with little or no loss of critical data during the process.  TMX is defined in two parts:  1) A specification of the format of the container (the higher-level elements that provide information about the file as a whole and about entries). In TMX, an entry consisting of aligned segments of text in two or more languages is called a Translation Unit (the &lt;TU&gt; element); 2) A low-level meta-markup format for the content of a segment of translation-memory text. In TMX, an individual segment of translation-memory text in a particular language is called a &lt;SEG&gt; element."</p>

<p>"TMX is XML-compliant (and therefore SGML-compliant as well). It also uses various ISO standards for date/time, language codes, and country codes.  TMX files are intended to be created automatically by export routines and processed automatically by import routines. TMX files are 'well-formed' XML documents that can be processed without explicit reference to the TMX DTD. However, a 'valid' TMX file must conform to the TMX DTD, and any suspicious TMX file should be validated against the TMX DTD using a general-purpose XML parser.  XML 'well-formed' documents may start with the XML processing statement, but it is not required."</p>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19980428]</em></p></rev>

<p>"We are currently defining a new XML language called AML, 'Astronomical Markup Language', aimed at being a standard exchange format for metadata in astronomy.  AML now supports the following objects (in the object-oriented sense):  astronomical object, article, table, set of tables, image, person.  This means that all these objects can be described with the same language, allowing easier establishing of links between them, and the creation of programs handling all these objects with the same user interface.  The following databases can already be queried in AML: Simbad, NED, ADS, and the Benn&amp;Martin people database. A java AML browser can be used to retrieve AML documents and browse them with a common user interface.   The creation of this language is a prerequisite for further work on information retrieval in astronomy, and it will allow the use of the same information by both humans and intelligent agents: the intelligent agents can use AML with an XML parser, while a browser for AML documents will be used to create an associated user interface."</p>

See <cite>Byte Magazine</cite> (May 1998) page 108, sidebar "So, Help Me, Java."  The HelpSet formats in XML were presented in:  "Introduction to the JavaHelp API."  By Eduardo Pelegr&iacute;-Llopart,  Roger Brinkley, and Nancy K. Lee (Sun Microsystems, Inc.)  Presented at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne</a> (Sun's 1998 Worldwide Java Developer Conference).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9805/sec8/art2.htm">"So, Help Me, Java."</a>  From <cite>Byte</cite>, May 1998: ". . . The new Java Help API, currently in beta testing, is an all-Java '&uuml;ber alles' help system for JavaBean components, applications, desktops, and HTML pages. . . [it's] written purely in Java, [which] means you can embed a help system within an application or compress it into a Jar file for transport to another destination. . . Java Help permits a single help system to support varying "navigational views" of help content. . . The data structure that carries all the information needed to provide a view into a help system is bundled into a HelpSet file.  Note that there are two "loose" terms at use here. First, a HelpSet file isn't necessarily a file, in the same sense as files that you store on your hard disk.  A HelpSet file could be bound into an application, for example. Second, it's probably more accurate to say that the information is rooted in the HelpSet file.  The structure of a HelpSet is XML-encoded (Extensible Markup Language) data. The data points to the URLs from which you can find the info necessary to build the help system."</p>

<rev><p><em>[CR: 19970918]</em></p></rev>

<p>"Cold Fusion is a general-purpose Web development system for rapidly building Web applications that integrate browser, server and database technologies.  It consists of the Cold Fusion Markup Language (CFML), the Cold Fusion Application Server (NT &amp; UNIX) and the forthcoming Cold Fusion Studio, a visual tool for building dynamic Web applications. . . In essence, CFML provides a generalized markup language for handling the richness of programming, logic and integration required to build full-scale applications on the Web platform.  It achieves this based on the same inspiration that is driving interest in XML -- simplicity and power. . . Syntactically, Custom Tags are XML compliant custom markup language elements that allow developers to build reusable components that can be easily dropped into a dynamic Web application. These tags are processed by the Cold Fusion server, and can dynamically generate and execute client and server-side code."</p>

<h3><a name="xml-javaSpeech">Java Speech Markup Language (JSML)</a></h3>

<p>"The Java(TM) Speech Markup Language (JSML) allows applications to annotate text with additional information that can improve the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech. JSML documents can include structural information about paragraphs and sentences. JSML allows control of the production of synthesized speech, including the pronunciation of words and phrases, the emphasis of words (stressing or accenting), the placements of boundaries and pauses, and the control of pitch and speaking rate. Finally, JSML allows markers to be embedded in text and allows synthesizer-specific controls."</p>

<p>"JSML is a subset of XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is a simple dialect of SGML. By being a subset of XML, JSML gains a standardized, extensible syntax that is not tied to the Java Speech API (JSAPI). This means that: (1) JSML is readable and editable by both humans and computers;  (2) General XML editors can be used to simplify writing JSML; (3) JSML markup is very regular and easy for a synthesizer to parse;  (4) Text containing JSML can be prepared by hand using non-JSAPI-specific editors."</p>

<p>"Sun Microsystems, Inc. has worked in partnership with leading speech technology companies to define the specifications for the Java Speech API and the Java Speech Markup Language (JSML). These companies bring decades of research on speech technology and experience in the development and use of speech applications. Sun is grateful for the contributions of: Apple Computer, Inc., AT&amp;T, Dragon Systems, Inc., IBM Corporation, Novell, Inc., Philips Speech Processing, Texas Instruments Incorporated.</p>

[Sun Microsystems, Program Manager, Global Engineering and Information Services].   This article constitutes part 2 in a planned four-part serial presentation on XML.  ". . . a series about XML, its promises, and its challenges . . ."  Excerpt:  "XML is displacing the traditional 'web page' -- generally a static document, created with HTML.   Most traditional web pages offer only slim interactivity and rely on an overworked server and CGI script.  XML is promoting the concept of a 'weblication' (web application) that can work wonders on the web client without generating so much Internet traffic. . . this merging of application functionality with web pages, which is a first principle of XML, reflects the merging of application functionality with documents that the Macintosh operating environment popularized since 1984.  The ability of web sites to do much more than simply deliver text and graphics is at the heart of XML's ascendancy.  XML is clearly a key component of the Internet's evolution from a communication channel to a data processing platform."

What is a "document" in the context of a networked world where pieces of information resident on different computers are combined "just in time" and "on the fly" to generate hignly interactive presentations of text and graphical content?  Just what is a 'micro-document'?  What then is document processing?  In this feature article of the Jan/Feb 1998 <cite>Gilbane Report</cite>, XML co-editor Tim Bray interacts with the term "document computing" (encompassing "at least electronic publishing, word processing, document management, and information retrieval") as a means of getting to tbe bottom of these and related questions.

Inso's own SGML viewer, DynaText, requires compiling the SGML material into DynaText format.  In contrast, the Synex viewer operates on raw SGML-tagged documents.  Among its more interesting capabilities are support for HyTime linking and client-side style sheets - two developments that anticipate the forthcoming XSL and XLL specifications being written by the W3C."</p></li>

"XML::Grove is a mid-level, in-memory object model for XML objects, somewhat above plain text elements and attributes and below XML-editor usable or W3C's Document Object Model (DOM).  XML::Grove is primarily intended for applications that need access to all the structural items of a document but do not need to preserve the formatting of the original source.  The biggest differences between DOM and XML::Grove is that XML::Grove uses Perl arrays and hashes for content and attributes, uses Perl scalars for character data, and does not maintain a `parent' pointer in it's objects.  XML::Grove is very similar to HTML::Element but without predefined element names or attributes.  XML::Grove requires an XML parser and currently supports Larry Wall's XML::Parser module (<a href="ftp://www.wall.org/pub/larry/">ftp://www.wall.org/pub/larry/</a>.

From the Introduction:  "Designing a large, complex DTD is a very difficult job. One reason of this difficulty comes from SGML's restriction on name spaces.  For element type names, SGML allows only one name space per document.  This restriction means, that if you intend to design a new DTD, you have to be familiar with all the element types you wish to use to construct the DTD, and have to select their names very carefully to avoid name conflicts.  This lack of modularity makes difficult to use separately designed declaration sets (parts of DTDs) in mixture to build up a complete DTD.  For example, if you want to use pre-defined declaration sets for 'tables' and 'math expressions' together to construct your own 'report' DTD, you have to examine whether there are any name conflicts between them or not.  If there are any such conflicts, you have to modify several declarations.  This restriction in name space makes impossible to treat these declaration sets as public (read only) texts.  Similar problems may occur on the parameter entity names."

Thompson (Language Technology Group, University of Edinburgh).  Draft date: October 15, 1997.  Overview: "In this paper I describe the XML-Data schemata proposal, concentrating on the motivation for and nature of the provision of an element-type hierarchy, in which element types can inherit attribute declarations and positions in content models from ancestors in the hierarchy. I argue that this represents a major improvement over the use of parameter entities to structure and maintain DTDs."  [<a href="thompsonSchemata.html">local archive copy</a>]</p></li>

Reference: Note 13 March, 1998 (Note-xml-bind-19980313).  "This document is a NOTE for discussion by the W3C XML-related groups.  It is primarily an alternative to the namespace proposal and a contribution to defining XLink requirements. RDF and XML-data designers may also find it relevant.  [Abstract:]  Current linking systems are based on links from elements (<i>i.e.</i>, instances of element types in a document).  This paper holds that several of the technologies under development by the W3C working groups are better characterized as links from types and names.  Suggestions are made for a general architecture to handle this, and for how this can be integrated into XLink.  Namespaces, parts of RDF, and SGML Open Catalogs are re-characterized as XLinks from types and names."  [<a href="jelliffeXMLBind980313.html">local archive copy</a>]</p></li>

It is a personal critique of XML 1.0 PR, especially in the light of the namespace proposal, RDF and XML-data. It may be seen as a contribution to user requirements for an XML 1.1.  XML Cut'n'Paste is a proposal for various conventions which address many sophisticated uses in Extensible Markup Language (XML) while retaining true to its underlying model, as an application of SGML."

<li><p>[November 01, 1997]  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/16/">A new submission to the W3C</a> from Electricit&eacute; de France, Research and Development Division.  The "STTS2" submission for "Simple Tree Transformation Sheets 2" would in principle govern the transformation of well-formed XML documents in order to render them in a HTML browser.  The submission abstract:  "This document describes a proprietary specification of Electricit&eacute; de France. It specifies the format of STTS2 transformation rules that can be applied to a HTML document (without CSS styles) in order to take advantage of the Cascading Style Sheets and remove deprecated HTML elements or attributes in favor of CSS. Even if the specification deals only with HTML, this kind of transformation, or an extension of this specification, can be easily applied on the fly to well-formed XML documents in order to render them in a HTML browser without any XML plug-in or internal knowledge.  The grammar of this specification is mainly based on the CSS2 grammar and extends it in some ways."</p></li>
